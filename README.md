# NFT Generator and Listing App

This project is an NFT generator and listing application that leverages the Stability Image Generation API to create unique NFT images. Users can generate NFTs and list them within the app, with images powered by Stability's API for high-quality, AI-generated artwork.

## Features
 - NFT Image Generation: Uses the Stability Image Generation API to generate unique images for NFTs.
 - NFT Listing: Allows users to list generated NFTs for display.
 - Environment Variable Management: API keys and sensitive information are stored in a .env file for security.

## Technologies Used
 - Flutter for front-end and cross-platform development.
 - Image Processing: Send an image along with a prompt and receive a processed response.
 - Dart for backend and Flutter logic.
